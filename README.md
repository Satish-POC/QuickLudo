# QuickLudo
Ludo Board Game created with Unity and Fun.



It's a hobby project. [Ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_%28board_game%29) is a board game.

When I started this project, I went through a few quick tutorials.
I found those tutorials informative, they were teaching unity. However many of them were not using any OOPs design concepts, rather they were teaching to code as in structural programming. That made the code extremely lengthy, unmaintainable and unreadable. 

Some of the advantages over what others are doing. 
1. DRY
2. OOAD & OOPs concepts
3. SOLID 
4. Making use of Event handlers.
5. Condensed and maintainable code.

I am not saying that code is perfect, it's just a POC and design can certainly be improved by greater extent. However, it's an effort to improve design while learning new technology alongside.

**Areas of Improvements**

 1. Over all design 
 2. Exception Handling 
 3. Unit Testing 
 4. Coding Standard
 5. Graphics and Animation
