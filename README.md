# QuickLudo
Ludo Board Game created with Unity and Fun.

***Purpose of the project is not focusing on coding standard but to learn some of the physics used in game and how gaming engine works. It truely undermines my .net coding otherwise.***

It's a hobby project. [Ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_%28board_game%29) is a board game.

When I started this project, I went through a few quick tutorials.
I found those tutorials informative, they were teaching unity. However many of them were not using any OOPs design concepts, rather they were teaching to code as in structural programming. That made the code extremely lengthy, unmaintainable and unreadable. 

Some of the advantages over what others are doing. 
1. DRY
2. OOAD & OOPs concepts
3. SOLID 
4. Making use of Event handlers.
5. Condensed and maintainable code.



**Areas of Improvements**

 1. Over all design 
 2. Exception Handling 
 3. Unit Testing 
 4. Coding Standard
 5. Graphics and Animation
