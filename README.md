# QuickLudo
Ludo Board Game created with Unity and Fun.



It's a hobby project. [Ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_%28board_game%29) is a board game.

When I started this project, I went through few quick tutorials. I found tutorials informative from Unity's point of view, however many of them were not using any OOPs design concepts, rather they were teaching to code as in structural programming.
